# Welcome to your GPT Engineer project

## Project info

**Project**: chatty-grove 

**URL**: https://run.gptengineer.app/projects/4f2014ee-a2b0-4955-816c-155634e0cf2b/improve

**Description**: I want to create a simple chat app in the browser that I can open in http://localhost:3000. It should have only one predefined global chat and no other rooms. First thing that the user sees is the register/login page where he has to create an account using username, email and password. There will be no email verification. When a user sends a message it will show the username in front of the message so everyone can see who sent the message. Technologies, styling and design are not important to make it as simple as possible. Messages sent should be stored in the database and when you are setting up a connection to the database use "127.0.0.1" instead of "localhost".

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

We don't support custom domains (yet). If you want to deploy your project under your own domain, then we recommend GitHub Pages.

To use GitHub Pages you will need to follow these steps: 
- Deploy your project using GitHub Pages - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site)
- Configure a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site - instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
